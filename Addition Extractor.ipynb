      "4-Methylmorpholine N-oxide (1.76 mL, 8.42 mmol) and potassium osmate dihydrate (97.3 mg, 0.38 mmol) were added to a solution of (5R,7aS)‐5‐butyl‐1H,3H,5H,7aH‐pyrrolo[1,2‐c][1,3]oxazol‐3‐one (347 mg, 1.91 mmol) in acetone/H2O (2:1, 54 mL).\n",
      "To a solution of H2PtCl6 (0.01 mmol, 4.28 mg) in 2 mL dry toluene in a 100 mL Fisher Porter tube was added 0.5 mmol of benzyl alcohol and 0.5 mmol of KH under N2 atmosphere.\n",
      "1 mL dry methanol was added to dissolve the precipitate and monitor the conversion in GCMS with mesitylene as an internal standard.\n",
      "(1S,2S)-1,2-Bis(2-hydroxyphenyl)-1,2-diaminoethane (1.0 g, 4.1 mmol, 1.0 equiv, 97%) is added through the open neck under a positive pressure of nitrogen.\n",
      "The open neck is capped with a rubber septum, and then anhydrous DMSO (20 mL, 99.8+%) and 2-methylbenzaldehyde (1.23 g, 10.2 mmol, 2.5 equiv, 97%) are added into the flask by syringe through the rubber septum.\n",
      "After the yellow solution is stirred for 14 h at 20 °C, the reaction is quenched by the addition of distilled water (100 mL), and the mixture is extracted with Et2O (20 mL × 3).\n",
      "Dichloromethane (0.4 M) is added to a round-bottomed flask.\n",
      "The benzylamine (1 equiv) and benzophenone imine (1 equiv) are then added and the flask is fitted with a drying tube (CaCl2).\n",
      "To a pyridine (60 ml) solution of Gd(OTf)3·9H2O (500 mg; 0.65 mmol) YbL·4H2O (200 mg; 0.22 mmol) is added.\n",
      "To the orange precipitate THF (25 ml) is added and the mixture is stirred overnight (in some cases all the precipitate dissolves at first, but overnight a pale yellow precipitate forms).\n",
      "To the cooled (0 ℃) solution of methyl 3,3-dimethylpent-4-enoate (2, 142 g, 1.0 mol) in dry THF (500 ml) was slowly added lithium aluminum hydride (38 g, 1 mol).\n",
      "The reaction was allowed to warm to room temperature and stirred for additional 30 min.\n",
      "After completion of the reaction, the reaction was cooled and then 4 M hydrochloric acid (1000 ml) was added dropwise until the reaction was clear solution.\n",
      "A stirred solution of rac-17a1 (330 mg, 0.64 mmol) in THF (12 mL) was added TBAF (1.0 M in THF, 0.7 mL, 0.70 mmol) at 0 oC.\n",
      "After all the solids had dissolved, silver hexafluorophosphate (0.276 g, 1.093 mmol) was added, affording a yellow to opaque orange color S23 change on formation of silver chloride precipitate.\n",
      "1,3-bis(2,6-di-iso-propylphenyl)-4,5-dimethylimidazolium chloride (0.340 g, 0.750 mmol) was added to a flame-dried Schlenk flask under an argon atmosphere.\n",
      "Dry THF (7.5 mL) was added with stirring, forming a slurry.\n",
      "Fresh potassium tert-butoxide (0.101 g, 0.900 mmol) was added to the flask in a single portion, causing gradual dissolution of the imidazolium salt and carbene formation.\n",
      "Stirring was continued at r.t. for 30 min before the addition of [Ir(COD)Cl]2.\n",
      "To a flame dried two necked round bottom flask, equipped with a stopcock, was added 4b (189 mg, 0.500 mmol, 1 eq.) and the iridium(I) catalyst (0.00325 mmol, 6.5 mol%).\n",
      "To this was added DCM (14.0 mL) and the solution cooled to 0 °C.\n",
      "A suspension of NaH (2.12 g, 52.9 mmol, 1.20 equiv, 60% in mineral oil) in THF/DMSO (10:1, 150 mL) was cooled to 0 °C followed by the dropwise addition of ethylene glycol (7.40 mL, 132 mmol, 3.00 equiv).\n",
      "After 1 h, the mixture was cooled to 0 °C followed by the dropwise addition of tributyl(iodomethyl)stannane (19.0 g, 44.1 mmol, 1.00 equiv).\n",
