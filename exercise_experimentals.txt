4-Methylmorpholine N-oxide (1.76 mL, 8.42 mmol) and potassium osmate dihydrate (97.3 mg, 0.38 mmol) were added to a solution of (5R,7aS)‐5‐butyl‐1H,3H,5H,7aH‐pyrrolo[1,2‐c][1,3]oxazol‐3‐one (347 mg, 1.91 mmol) in acetone/H2O (2:1, 54 mL). After the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 5 h, the solvents were removed under reduced pressure. Traces of water were removed from the mixture by azeotropic distillations with toluene (2 x 5 mL) under reduced pressure and the residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (hexane/EtOAc = 3/1) to give (5S,6S,7R,7aS)-5-Butyl-6,7-dihydroxytetrahydropyrrolo[1,2-c]oxazol-3(1H)-one (398 mg, 97%) as brown oil.

To a solution of H2PtCl6 (0.01 mmol, 4.28 mg) in 2 mL dry toluene in a 100 mL Fisher Porter tube was added 0.5 mmol of benzyl alcohol and 0.5 mmol of KH under N2 atmosphere. The tube was closed and was taken out from the glovebox and purged with 2 bar of ammonia for 3 times and finally pressurized with 7 bar of ammonia. The reaction mixture was stirred at 150°C for 24h, cooled down to room temperature and the ammonia pressure was released in the hood. 1 mL dry methanol was added to dissolve the precipitate and monitor the conversion in GCMS with mesitylene as an internal standard.

An oven-dried, 100-mL, two-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stir bar (13 × 9 mm, octagon-type), a rubber septum, and a nitrogen line is evacuated under high vacuum (1.0 mmHg) and filled with nitrogen (three cycles). (1S,2S)-1,2-Bis(2-hydroxyphenyl)-1,2-diaminoethane (1.0 g, 4.1 mmol, 1.0 equiv, 97%) is added through the open neck under a positive pressure of nitrogen. The open neck is capped with a rubber septum, and then anhydrous DMSO (20 mL, 99.8+%) and 2-methylbenzaldehyde (1.23 g, 10.2 mmol, 2.5 equiv, 97%) are added into the flask by syringe through the rubber septum. After the yellow solution is stirred for 14 h at 20 °C, the reaction is quenched by the addition of distilled water (100 mL), and the mixture is extracted with Et2O (20 mL × 3). The combined organic layer is washed with water (30 mL) and a saturated aqueous solution of NaCl (30 mL), dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 (5 g), filtered through filter paper, and concentrated by rotary evaporation (30 mmHg, 30 °C) and under vacuum (1.0 mmHg). The product, obtained as a yellow oil as a mixture with unreacted 2-methylbenzaldehyde, is used in the next step without further purification (2.2 g, ~98% yield).

Dichloromethane (0.4 M) is added to a round-bottomed flask. The benzylamine (1 equiv) and benzophenone imine (1 equiv) are then added and the flask is fitted with a drying tube (CaCl2). The reaction mixture is stirred for 16 h at room temperature. The solvent is removed by rotary evaporation and the ketimine is used without further purification.

To a pyridine (60 ml) solution of Gd(OTf)3·9H2O (500 mg; 0.65 mmol) YbL·4H2O (200 mg; 0.22 mmol) is added. When a clear orange solution has formed, the solution is heated to boiling and refluxed for 3 hours. After being refluxed the solution is cooled to room temperature and then poured into diethyl ether (300 ml) which is vigorously stirred. This produces a fine orange precipitate which is isolated, washed twice with diethyl ether (2 x 100 ml) and then dried. The product is then extracted with dichloromethane (100 ml). The orange dichloromethane solution is filtered and evaporated to dryness. To the orange precipitate THF (25 ml) is added and the mixture is stirred overnight (in some cases all the precipitate dissolves at first, but overnight a pale yellow precipitate forms). The pale yellow precipitate is isolated and washed with THF (3x15 ml) and diethyl ether (2x10 ml). Yield: 217 mg (66 %).

To the cooled (0 ℃) solution of methyl 3,3-dimethylpent-4-enoate (2, 142 g, 1.0 mol) in dry THF (500 ml) was slowly added lithium aluminum hydride (38 g, 1 mol). The reaction was allowed to warm to room temperature and stirred for additional 30 min. After completion of the reaction, the reaction was cooled and then 4 M hydrochloric acid (1000 ml) was added dropwise until the reaction was clear solution. The reaction mixture was extracted with ethylacetate (2 × 500 ml). The combined organic layer was washed with brine (500 ml), dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 and concentrated under vacuum to give colorless oil 3 (113 g, 0.99 mol, 99%) which was pure enough for next step without further purification.

A stirred solution of rac-17a1 (330 mg, 0.64 mmol) in THF (12 mL) was added TBAF (1.0 M in THF, 0.7 mL, 0.70 mmol) at 0 oC. After being stirred for 30 min with ice-water bath, the mixture was quenched with saturated aqueous NH4Cl, and extracted with ethyl acetate (10 mL × 3). The organic layer was washed with brine (10 mL × 3), dried over by anhydrous Na2SO4 and concentrated in vacuo. The crude oil was purified by column chromatography (petroleum ether/ethyl acetate = 3:1) gave rac-18a1 (247 mg, 96.4%) as a shallow yellow oil.

The yellow complex, chloro(ƞ4–cycloocta–1,5–diene)(1,3-dimesitylimidazol-2-ylidene) iridium(I) (0.700 g, 1.093 mmol),30 was dissolved in dry THF (15 mL) in a previously flame-dried roundbottom flask, fitted with a stopcock sidearm. After all the solids had dissolved, silver hexafluorophosphate (0.276 g, 1.093 mmol) was added, affording a yellow to opaque orange color S23 change on formation of silver chloride precipitate. The reaction mixture was stirred for 15 min at r.t. before carrying out filtration through celite under argon, using flame-dried glassware. Addition of triphenylphosphine (0.287 g, 1.093 mmol) to the resulting clear orange solution led to the immediate appearance of a bright red color. Finally, after stirring the solution for 1 h at r.t., the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The red residue was redissolved in DCM (10 mL) and filtered through celite in air, washing out any red material from the celite with DCM. The clear red filtrate was concentrate in vacuo to reveal a red, oily solid. Addition of ethyl acetate (~5 mL) resulted in the precipitation of the product as bright red solid, which was collected by filtration, then washed with ethyl acetate and hexanes and dried (0.885 g, 80%). The isolated catalyst was dried in a vacuum oven (40 oC, 0 bar) for 24 h before use.

1,3-bis(2,6-di-iso-propylphenyl)-4,5-dimethylimidazolium chloride (0.340 g, 0.750 mmol) was added to a flame-dried Schlenk flask under an argon atmosphere. Dry THF (7.5 mL) was added with stirring, forming a slurry. Fresh potassium tert-butoxide (0.101 g, 0.900 mmol) was added to the flask in a single portion, causing gradual dissolution of the imidazolium salt and carbene formation. Stirring was continued at r.t. for 30 min before the addition of [Ir(COD)Cl]2. An instant colorless to bright yellow color change occurred, slowly turning to dark yellow over the course of 16 h. Removal of the solvent in vacuo followed by purification through a short plug of silica (eluting with 1:1 petroleum ether/Et2O) gave the product as a bright yellow solid (0.227 g, 40%).

To a flame dried two necked round bottom flask, equipped with a stopcock, was added 4b (189 mg, 0.500 mmol, 1 eq.) and the iridium(I) catalyst (0.00325 mmol, 6.5 mol%). To this was added DCM (14.0 mL) and the solution cooled to 0 °C. The flask was evacuated and flushed three times via a deuterium balloon. The solution was left open to this balloon for the duration of the reaction. The flask was immediately transferred to a heating block, preset to 25 °C, and stirred for 2 hours.

A suspension of NaH (2.12 g, 52.9 mmol, 1.20 equiv, 60% in mineral oil) in THF/DMSO (10:1, 150 mL) was cooled to 0 °C followed by the dropwise addition of ethylene glycol (7.40 mL, 132 mmol, 3.00 equiv). The suspension was allowed to warm to room temperature. After 1 h, the mixture was cooled to 0 °C followed by the dropwise addition of tributyl(iodomethyl)stannane (19.0 g, 44.1 mmol, 1.00 equiv). The reaction mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature and heated at 55 °C for 18 h. The reaction was quenched carefully with deionized H2O (30 mL) and phase-separated. The aqueous phase was extracted with MTBE (100 mL × 2). The combined organic phase was washed with deionized H2O (50 mL × 2), brine (50 mL), dried over Na2SO4 and concentrated to dryness. The residue was purified by flash column chromatography (hexanes/EtOAc; v/v = 10/1) to afford 2- ((tributylstannyl)methoxy)ethan-1-ol (M2) as a colorless liquid (11.2 g, 70%).
